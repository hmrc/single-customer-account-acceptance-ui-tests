# single-customer-account-acceptance-ui-tests
UI test suite for the `Single Customer Account` using WebDriver and `<scalatest/cucumber>`.  

## Running the tests

Prior to executing the tests ensure you have:
 - Appropriate [drivers installed](#installing-local-driver-binaries) - to run tests against locally installed Browser
 - Installed/configured [service manager](https://github.com/hmrc/service-manager).  

Run the following command to start services locally:
    sm --start SCA_FUTURES_ALL -r --wait 100

Using the `--wait 100` argument ensures a health check is run on all the services started as part of the profile. `100` refers to the given number of seconds to wait for services to pass health checks.

To run tests on local environment use below command:
    ./run_tests.sh <browser-driver> <environment> 

To run tests on QA environment use below command:
    ./run_sca_contract_tests.sh <broswer-driver> <environment>

Note: browser-driver and environment are optional and default driver is chrome if no input is provided. 

## Running ZAP tests
Currently ZAP tests are run on local environment using Jenkins build.

#### Tagging tests for ZAP

It is not required to proxy every journey test via ZAP. The intention of proxying a test through ZAP is to expose all the
 relevant pages of an application to ZAP. So tagging a subset of the journey tests or creating a 
 single ZAP focused journey test is sufficient.

#### Configuring the browser to proxy via ZAP 

Setting the system property `zap.proxy=true` configures the browser specified in `browser` property to proxy via ZAP. 
This is achieved using [webdriver-factory](https://github.com/hmrc/webdriver-factory#proxying-trafic-via-zap).

#### Executing a ZAP test

The shell script `run_zap_tests.sh` is available to execute ZAP tests. The script proxies a set of journey tests, 
tagged as `ZapTests`, via ZAP.  

For example, to execute ZAP tests locally using a Chrome browser

```
./run_zap_tests.sh chrome local
```

### Running tests using BrowserStack
If you would like to run your tests via BrowserStack from your local development environment please refer to the [webdriver-factory](https://github.com/hmrc/webdriver-factory/blob/main/README.md/#user-content-running-tests-using-browser-stack) project.

## Installing local driver binaries

This project supports UI test execution using Firefox (Geckodriver) and Chrome (Chromedriver) browsers. 

See the `drivers/` directory for some helpful scripts to do the installation work for you.  They should work on both Mac and Linux by running the following command:

    ./installGeckodriver.sh <operating-system> <driver-version>
    or
    ./installChromedriver <operating-system> <driver-version>

- *<operating-system>* defaults to **linux64**, however it also supports **macos**
- *<driver-version>* defaults to **0.21.0** for Gecko/Firefox, and the latest release for Chrome.  You can, however, however pass any version available at the [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/tags) or [Chromedriver](http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/) repositories.

**Note 1:** *You will need to ensure that you have a recent version of Chrome and/or Firefox installed for the later versions of the drivers to work reliably.*

**Note 2** *These scripts use sudo to set the right permissions on the drivers so you will likely be prompted to enter your password.*

### Scalafmt
